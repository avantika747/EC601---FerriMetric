# EC601---FerriMetric
FerriMetric is a tool at the intersection of Nutrition Science and Artificial Intelligence that provides numeric metrics for the assessment of iron levels in humans.

Keywords: Nutrition Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Random Forest Regression, Bioavailability of Iron, Transferrin Saturation, K-means Clustering, Temporal Dietary Patterns, Feature Engineering

1. Calculating the amount of iron (when ingested through daily diet) that was actually available for absorption by the body.
2. Model-1: Engineering a new feature for the above estimation that takes into consideration the effect of iron absorption enhancers, inhibitors and the type of meal consumed.
3. Model-2: Taking laboratory values such as Iron Serum and UIBC (Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity) to calculate TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity) and subsequently Transferrin Saturation, which is the percentage of iron bound to the iron-binding sites of the blood protein, Transferrin.
4. Making use of USDA's Nutritional Information API to extract the nutritional information of vairous popular meals (in standard units) from different countries.
